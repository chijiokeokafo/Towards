		<h2>Calla: Redefining Luxury</h2>
		<h3>An Interview with Calla Haynes</h3>

		<p class="intro-rule"></p>

		<p>Calla Haynes is a young designer based in Paris who has been garnering much attention as of late. Combining beautiful, layered prints, with a modern and tailored silhouette, she is redefining the notion of luxury for a new generation. We caught up with her to discuss inspiration, the changing nature of the fashion industry and processes behind some of her work. </p>

	<p class="question"><span class="name">Kevin Boothe:</span> Hi Calla, I want to start by thanking you for taking time to talk to us. You grew up in Toronto, before moving New York to study if I’m not mistaken. At what age did you decide you wanted to work in fashion?</p>
	

	<p class="answer"><span class="name">Calla Haynes:</span> There wasn’t one particular moment when the idea popped into my head and I announced it to the world. It’s always been the only option for me… from drawing out costumes from old movies I would watch with my mom at 7 years old &mdash; to teaching myself to sew at 12… it was always natural.</p>


		<p class="question">While in Paris you began working with Olivier Theyskens first at Rochas, and then later at Nina Ricci. Can you talk a little bit about how that came about and what it was like?</p>

		<p class="answer">The plan was to stay in Paris for one year &mdash; my third year of design school, at Parsons Paris (on exchange from Parsons New York). During the school year, I interned with Robert Normand, a young designer who at the end of my internship introduced me to members of Olivier Theyskens team at Rochas. I was offered an internship but the catch was I had to stay 6 months, meaning I could not return to New York for school. Olivier had only been at Rochas for one season, and the team was very small. I was their first intern in the studio and I quickly found a place for myself designing fabrics, drawing flats. It was an amazing experience to be part of such a small, creative team. I was present at all fittings, I followed the entire design process.I definitely learned a lot, and enjoyed my time immensely.</p>

		<p class="question">Something I’m particularly interested in is the process behind your beautiful prints, which is something you have become well-known for. But first, how and where did you originally get interested in printmaking?</p>
		
				<p class="answer">Print design wasn’t something I explored intensely at Parsons, but when I arrived at Rochas the Photoshop and Illustrator skills I had developed there came in very handy. I first started designing jacquards and embroideries with Illustrator using a very graphic approach, but as the technology of inkjet printing evolved, I did more and more work in Photoshop, adding blur effects, multiple colours etc.</p>
					
		<p class="question">Without giving away any secrets, can you tell us something about the steps you took, from conception to execution, when you were designing the prints for your autumn/winter 2010/11 collection?</p>
		
		<p class="answer">I keep my eyes open for textures, art, photographs that inspire me, that feel new and fresh. Once I’ve amassed a large quantity of them on my computer’s desktop, I start playing around with them on Photoshop. I consider it collage work. An average print will have about 30-40 layers + masks, + curves, + levels…</p>

		<p class="question">You describe Calla as ‘relaxed luxury.’ The idea of luxury and the luxury market has undergone drastic changes in the past couple of years. How do you personally define luxury and what are some of your favorite personal luxuries? </p>
		
		<p class="answer">Luxury is easiness. It’s a luxury to wake up and be ready to walk out the door in 15 minutes. It’s a luxury for life to be effortless, well at least dressing maybe! I think in these past couple years we’ve seen which luxury houses can survive anything, and they are the ones that have the upmost quality and the most refined details. To me luxury does not mean red carpet glamour &mdash; it means comfort, refinement, ease. Luxury should be subtle, even sometimes a secret.</p>
		
				<p class="question"> Over the past decade, the relationship between media and the fashion industry has also experienced dramatic changes. From bloggers in the front row, to the live streaming of runway shows, does this change how you approach the marketing of your product? What do you think are the most significant changes this shifting media landscape has brought to the fashion industry?</p>
		
		
			<p class="answer">I think it’s exciting that fashion is at the forefront of new media. I’m a big fan of blogs, and we have had a lot of support from important blogs that I believe have made a difference in our commercial success. (JC Report, Style Bubble, Jak & Jil, Hint Mag, The Cut, Refinery 29) They are able to get information out the fastest, to a worldwide audience. For a new brand like us it has been invaluable… That being said, I think it’s also quite dangerous too. A year ago, one could see a new collection on style.com the day after it took place, this season you could live stream it and see as it happened. I’m not sure how good it is to get consumers excited about a product 6 months before it hits stores &mdash; they’re most likely going to be over it once it hits stores. Fashion shows operate more or less like they did 40 years ago. The market and the media has changed so drastically, I think the way we show should too. It’s an exciting time because I really believe there are no rules.</p>

				<p class="question">A topic that seems to really have come to light earlier this year with the tragic passing of Alexander McQueen is the role of creativity vs. commerce in the fashion industry. This is something that I imagine you must have been exposed to early, through your time with Olivier Theyskens. How do you personally balance the two? How much of a struggle is it?</p>
		

				<p class="answer">I deal with it much differently than Olivier for many reasons. First and foremost, I am a woman and I cannot help but to imagine myself in the clothes, how they would feel, how they would fit , how I could move in them. Wearability becomes much more a factor.

I have a much smaller sized collection which forces me to get to the commercial point much faster. The entire collection is destined for the store.

I present on a much smaller scale. No spectacular runway show. Ready-to-wear is my only product, where as Rochas and Nina Ricci had many other products to sell (perfume, accessories, licences) that’s success depended on the press garnered by the ready-to-wear collection. All that being said, it’s important that my pieces are visually unique and fresh and new. I accomplish this best with the original prints and textiles, and by adding unexpected, unique details and finishings to my pieces.</p>

				<p class="question">The pieces from your most recent collection strike me as subtle and understated with beautiful detailing. I’ve read that you make all of your garments in France, do you mind walking us through the production process for any of these given pieces? Is there an average timeline from initial conception of a piece until you are holding the finished product in your hands?</p>

				<p class="answer">The prototypes of a collection are developed over around 3 months. After sketching, I either develop the pattern myself or with a pattern drafter in Paris. We sew a toile (muslin) to test the shape. Modifications are made to the fit, length etc. and the pattern is corrected. While this is all happening, the fabric is being developed. Most prototypes are made directly in factory.</p>

				<p class="question"> The theme for this issue is ‘Where are we now?’; and the goal is that it will provide a survey and creating a dialogue about the state of current culture. What are, in your opinion, the most important recent developments in women’s fashion? Which of these do you feel are positives changes, and which are negative?</p>

				<p class="answer">New media, the speed at which we receive information has definitely been important. It’s positive and negative as I discussed above. For my work, inkjet printing has developed only over the last 10 years and has drastically changed printmaking. It’s lowered costs and opened up creative possibilites. In the past silkscreening limited the amount of colour you could use, now a print can have a million colours.</p>

				<p class="question"> To finish off, are there any upcoming projects you are involved with that you’d like to let readers know about?</p>


<p class="answer">The spring summer collection is available at The Room in Toronto, Maria Luisa in Paris and Debut in New York. The fall winter collection will also be available at Opening Ceremony in New York and Los Angeles.</p>
