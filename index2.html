		      <p>
		      	I was first introduced to Colleen Heslin’s work by a mutual friend last spring. Upon visiting her Montreal studio, I was immediatly taken by her large, collage&mdash;like canvases. Her attention to detail and the interplay between process, material, and surface was quite striking. After speaking further and learning that she had originally studied photography, we agreed it would be interesting to have her document the summer residency that she and her partner, Les Ramsay were about embark on. 	<a href="colleenheslin.html">Read More</a>
